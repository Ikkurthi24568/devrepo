git init  <! it will initialize github in local system>
git add filename or .  <! add your files to git local repository>
git status <! it will show the files status traked or modified or nothing >
git commit -m "description about chnage" <! local commit>
git status
git log <!-check the commit id info>
git log --oneline  <! it will display the commit id with short number and description>
git show <! it will show last git commit id info>
git show commitid <!it will show commit id related info more>

When you 1st time commiting the code
It will show 
Git config --global user.email "murali.rgvm@gmail.com"
Git config --global user.name " Muralli"

Git branch -M main <! This command we used to change the local repository name master to main>

Git remote add origin https://github.com/DevopsLn/Development.git <! Here origin means refernce to git url, Development means repository name>

Git remote -v <! It will display what are the repositories availabe>

Git push or git push -u origin main <! It means, your local code pushing to remote repository>

Note : When you are pushing the code to remote repository , It will ask you credentials .

You can access remote repository through hhtps or ssh
If it is https : user name and token 
If it is ssh : key (pub and private)

We can generate the token by login github through gui
Go to account settings--> developments--setting--Persanl access token--tokens(classics)- generate token classisc
---name it as windows token-- expiry-- 

Save the token one it close , you may not get it.
Either you need to regenerate or save it.

Once token access done, you could push successfully. 

Now you have developed the code locally and pushed to Github repository.

=================================================================

Same repository sharing by multiple developers.

Same code needs to another resource, they need to get the code from git to their machine in linux.

Create instance in GCP
Ssh connect
Check git installed or not by enter git
If not 
Sudo -I
Cat /etc/*rele*
apt update -y
apt install git -y
Git 
Git clone https://github.com/DevopsLn/Development.git 
Now you can do ls
Cd project
Ls -la
You can see .git folder < it will be track all the your prject info and >

Vim newfile
Git add .
Git commit -m "desc msg"

Again it will ask mail id and user name details 

Git config --global user.email "murali.rgvm@gmail.com"
Git config --global user.name " Mural


Git commit -m  "desc msg"

HEAD will reference to current commit.



We need push the code to remote repository 
we need to add our local code to remote repository

git
